#Pi VU Meter
This library is a fork of original great Pimoroni library https://github.com/pimoroni/pivumeter.
I have added some modification on blickt device and added ws2812-strip device to manage a strip of RGB leds.
For doing that I have used cloned rpi_ws281x library from https://github.com/jgarff/rpi_ws281x.
